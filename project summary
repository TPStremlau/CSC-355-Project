The purpose of our database is to maintain records for a pet adoption system. It keeps track of clients, pets, 
pet adoption centers, and employees in the system. This system could be used by a pet adoption company with 
multiple adoption centers. This database allows us to answer questions about things such as which employees 
work at which centers, the medical history of pets which may affect who wants to adopt them, and client history 
to keep track of past adoptions and which pets belong to which customers. For example, if a pet went missing and 
was brought into a pet adoption center, it could be tracked back to the client who adopted it so the pet could 
be returned using the clients contact details. It also records things like the clients background information 
in case they have a history of animal abuse and should not be allowed to adopt pets in the future. Overall, this 
database maintains important information on clients, centers, pets, and employees to ensure the business 
functions smoothly and important information is easily accessible and up to date.
